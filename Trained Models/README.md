## Task A: Modes of Locomotion
The goal of this task is to classify modes of locomotion from body-worn sensors. A model with nine different hyperparameter changes has been trained for this task. In addition, Null and No Null classes were also evaluated, and their results were compared.

## Task B: Gestures
This task concerns the recognition of right arm movements performed in the daily activitiesâ€™ scenario included in the OPPORTUNITY dataset. A full set of sensors are under consideration for this task, including a motion jacket, 12 Bluetooth accelerometers fitted to the body, and inertial sensors in the feet.
